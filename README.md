# Word_Board_Game
Python Programming to create a Word_Board_Game. Made by me!

"""A board is a list of list of str. For example, the board:
  NEWJ
  SLEN
is represented as the list
  [["N", "E", "W", "J"], ["S", "L", "E", "N"]]
  
A word list is a list of str. For example, the list of words
  NEW
  LEN
  DOT
  SO
is represented as the list
  ["NEW", "LEN", "DOT, "SO"]
"""

Once a player spots a word out of the board, this word will be examnied through a word list to check whether this word is valid.
